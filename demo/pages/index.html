<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Almond.CSS is a collection of CSS styles to make simple websites look nicer and better. 
  On this demo page, we will go through the main components from this lightweight CSS library.
  Then we will also add the extended styles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Important</strong>:
  If you want a static page with all the styles in one place and that doesn't require JavaScript
  to work, <a href="./old/">visit the old demo page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Almond.CSS has two versions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regular: it has styles for all the elements, including icons, background images, and widgets.</li>
  <li>Lite: it has just the styles (no graphics or widgets).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>The lite version is 3KB once minified and gzipped.</b> But if you want to have all the additional features,
  the regular version is a good choice (and it's only 5KB minified and gzipped, so there's not much 
  difference in size.)
</p>
<p>
  This demo page was built using the regular version of Almond.CSS, and adding some extra styles for the
  layout. Use the menu on the left side (top if you are on mobile) to see all the available elements 
  and styles.
